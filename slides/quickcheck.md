# Basic QuickCheck 

# Some properties

```haskell
reverse_involutive :: [Int] -> Bool
reverse_involutive xs = 
    xs == (reverse . reverse) xs
```

```haskell
sort_idempotent :: [Int] -> Bool
sort_idempotent xs = 
    sort xs == (sort . sort) xs
```

```haskell
map_reverse :: Blind (Int -> String) -> [Int] -> Bool
map_reverse (Blind f) xs = 
    (reverse . map f) xs == (map f . reverse) xs
```

# Potential pitfall 1 - exhaustion

```haskell
mod2_precondition :: [Int] -> Property
mod2_precondition xs =
  all ((== 0) . (`mod` 2)) xs ==>
    xs == map ((* 2) . (`div` 2)) xs
```

```haskell
> mod2_precondition
*** Gave up! Passed only 62 tests.
```

# Workaround

```haskell
newtype EvenList a = EvenList { getList :: [a] }
                  deriving (Eq, Show)

instance (Arbitrary a, Integral a) => 
  Arbitrary (EvenList a) where
    arbitrary = EvenList <$> oneof [
                return []
              , liftM2 (:)
                  (liftM (* 2) arbitrary)
                  (liftM getList arbitrary)
              ]
```

# Workaround

```haskell
mod2_precondition :: EvenList Int -> Bool
mod2_precondition (EvenList xs) =
    xs == map ((* 2) . (`div` 2)) xs

> quickCheck mod2_precondition
+++ OK, passed 100 tests.
```

# Potential pitfall 2 - coverage

```haskell
mod2_precondition :: EvenList Int -> Property
mod2_precondition (EvenList xs) =
    collect (length xs) $
    xs == map ((* 2) . (`div` 2)) xs

# Potential pitfall 3 - infinite structures

```haskell
data EvenTree a = Leaf
                | Node (EvenTree a) a (EvenTree a)
                deriving (Eq, Show)

instance (Arbitrary a, Integral a) 
  => Arbitrary (EvenTree a) where
    arbitrary = frequency [
                (1, return Leaf)
              , (3, liftM3 Node 
                      arbitrary 
                      ((* 2) <$> arbitrary) 
                      arbitrary)
              ]
```

# Workaround

```haskell
instance (Arbitrary a, Integral a) => 
  Arbitrary (EvenTree a) where
    arbitrary = sized arbTree

arbTree :: (Arbitrary a, Integral a) 
        => Int -> Gen (EvenTree a)
arbTree 0 = return Leaf
arbTree n = frequency [
            (1, return Leaf)
          , (3, liftM3 Node 
                  shrub 
                  ((* 2) <$> arbitrary) 
                  shrub)
          ]
  where
   shrub = arbTree (n `div` 2)
```

# Testing from specifications

# An abstract queue

```haskell
empty   :: Queue a
isEmpty :: Queue a -> Bool
peek    :: Queue a -> a
add     :: a -> Queue a -> Queue a
remove  :: Queue a -> Queue a
```
# An algebraic specification

```haskell
isEmpty empty             = True
isEmpty (add x xq)        = False

peek (add x empty)        = x
peek (add x (add y yq))   = peek (add y yq)

remove (add x empty)      = empty
remove (add x (add y yq)) = add x (remove (add y yq))
```

<!--
- peek and remove blow up on empty lists
- `add x` has to be strict or we run into trouble
- can turn any list into some number of joins and an empty, is unique
- polymorphic code is tested with concrete types
  - you might test something with Int (+ is associative)
    that could fail with Double (where it isn't)
-->

# A list-based queue

```haskell
type Queue a = [a]

empty = []              -- empty :: Queue a

isEmpty = null          -- isEmpty :: Queue a -> Bool

peek = head             -- peek :: Queue a -> a

add x xs = xs ++ [x]    -- add :: a -> Queue a -> Queue a

remove = tail           -- remove :: Queue a -> Queue a
```

# The algebraic specification in QuickCheck

```haskell
-- isEmpty empty             = True
-- isEmpty (add x xq)        = False

emptyAssert :: Assertion
emptyAssert = 
    isEmpty empty @?= True

nonEmptyProp :: Int -> Queue Int -> Bool
nonEmptyProp x = 
    not . isEmpty . add x
```

# The algebraic specification in QuickCheck

```haskell
-- peek (add x empty)        = x
-- peek (add x (add y yq))   = peek (add y yq)

peekAddEmptyProp :: Int -> Bool
peekaddEmptyProp x = 
    peek (add x empty) == x

peekAddNonEmptyProp :: Int -> Queue Int -> Property
peekAddNonEmptyProp x xs = 
    (not . isEmpty) xs ==> 
        peek (add x xs) == peek xs
```

# The algebraic specification in QuickCheck

```haskell
-- remove (add x empty)      = empty
-- remove (add x (add y yq)) = add x (remove (add y yq))

removeAddEmptyProp :: Int -> Bool
removeAddEmptyProp x =
    remove (add x empty) == empty

removeAddNonEmptyProp :: Int -> Queue Int -> Property
removeAddNonEmptyProp x xs = 
    (not . isEmpty) xs ==>
        remove (add x xs) `equiv` add x (remove xs)
```

<!--
- HUnit for fixed cases
- equiv function to smooth out differences in representation
- mix of adds and removes in arbitrary can help coverage of 
  representations
  - make sure you don't use remove when the list is empty
-->

# Model-based testing

# A faster queue

```haskell
data Queue a = Queue [a] [a]

empty = Queue [] []

isEmpty (Queue xs ys) = null xs

peek (Queue (x : _) _) = x

remove (Queue (_ : xs) ys) = mkValid xs ys

add x (Queue xs ys) = mkValid xs (x : ys)

mkValid [] ys = Queue (reverse ys) []
mkValid xs ys = Queue xs ys
```

#   The setup

```haskell
import qualified FastQueue as F
import qualified ListQueue as L

toBasic :: F.Queue a -> L.Queue a
valid :: F.Queue a -> Bool
```

# Testing the model

```haskell
emptyAssertion =
  toBasic F.empty @?= L.empty

isEmptyProperty q = 
    F.isEmpty q == (L.isEmpty . toBasic) q
```

# Testing the model

```haskell
peekProperty q = 
  (not . F.isEmpty) q ==>
    F.peek q == (L.peek . toBasic) q

addProperty x q = 
    (toBasic . F.add x) q == (L.add x . toBasic) q

removeProperty q = 
  (not . F.isEmpty) q ==> 
    (toBasic . F.remove) q == (L.remove . toBasic) q
```

# Testing monadic code 

# General points

- We want the ability to 
    - generate an arbitrary list of actions that we can perform
    - carry out those actions in a context

- We can model actions using the free monad version of the monad under test

- We can use Arbitrary to generate a list of these actions
    - requires some thinking to make sure that we remain in a valid state 

# General points

```haskell
data QueueF a k = Empty k
                | IsEmpty (Bool -> k)
                | Peek (a -> k)
                | Remove k
                | Add a k
                deriving (Functor)

type Queue a r = Free (QueueF a) r
```

# General points

```haskell
import qualified Queue.Free as F
type Action a = F.Queue a ()
 
actions :: Arbitrary a => Int -> Gen [Action a]
actions n = oneof $ [
            return []
          , liftM2 (:)
             (liftM F.add arbitrary)
             (actions (n + 1))
          ] ++ if n == 0 then [] else [
            liftM (F.remove :) (actions (n - 1))
          , liftM (void F.peek :) (actions n)
          ]
```

# General points

```haskell
type Queue s a = STRef s (V.Vector a)

perform :: Queue s a -> [Action a] -> ST s [a]
perform sq = execWriterT . mapM_ step
  where
    step (Free (F.Peek _)) = do
      x <- lift . peek $ sq
      tell [x]
    step (Free (F.Add x _)) = 
      lift . add x $ sq
    step (Free (F.Remove _)) = 
    ...
```

# Monadic code and specifications

- We want to be able to model a sequence of actions and 
  get a trace of some observations of the internal state

- If two sequences of actions gives the same trace of 
  internal states in all contexts, they are observationally equivalent

- Context matters
    - both before and after the property of interest

# Monadic code and specifications

```haskell
observe :: [Action a] -> ST s [a]
observe xs = empty >>= \q -> perform q xs

testEquiv xs ys = do
  forAll (actions 0) $ \prefix -> 
  forAll (actions (delta (prefix ++ xs))) $ \suffix -> 
  let
    o1 = runST $ observe (prefix ++ xs ++ suffix)
    o2 = runST $ observe (prefix ++ ys ++ suffix)
  in
    o1 == o2 

addPeekProp m n = 
  testEquiv [F.add m, F.add n, void F.peek] 
            [F.add m, void F.peek, F.add n]
```

# Monadic code and models

```haskell

addProperty :: Int -> Property
addProperty x = 
  forAll (actions 0) $ \as -> runST $ do
  q <- empty
  void $ perform q as
  q' <- toList q      
  let l' = L.add x q' -- l' = L.add x . toList
  add x q
  r' <- toList q      -- r' = toList . ST.add x
  return $ l' == r'

addProperty :: Int -> Property
addProperty x = implements (L.add x) (ST.add x)
```

# Monadic QuickCheck API

```haskell
assert :: Monad m => Bool -> PropertyM m ()

pre :: Monad m => Bool -> PropertyM m ()

run :: Monad m => m a -> PropertyM m a

pick :: (Monad m, Show a) => Gen a -> PropertyM m a
```

# Monadic QuickCheck API

Before
```haskell
testEquiv xs ys = do
  forAll (actions 0) $ \prefix -> 
  forAll (actions (delta (prefix ++ xs))) $ \suffix -> 
  let
    o1 = runST $ observe (prefix ++ xs ++ suffix)
    o2 = runST $ observe (prefix ++ ys ++ suffix)
  in
    o1 == o2 
```

# Monadic QuickCheck API

After
```haskell
testEquiv xs ys = monadicST $ do
  prefix <- pick $ actions 0
  suffix <- pick $ actions (delta (prefix ++ xs))

  equivalent <- run $ liftM2 (==) 
    (observe (prefix ++ xs ++ suffix))
    (observe (prefix ++ ys ++ suffix))

  assert equivalent
```

# Monadic code and pre-/post-conditions

```haskell
addPeek y = monadicST $ do
  prefix <- pick (actions 0)

  q <- run empty
  run . void $ perform q prefix

  hasElems <- run . liftM not . isEmpty $ q
  pre hasElems

  equivalent <- run $ do
    x <- peek q
    add y q
    x' <- peek q
    return (x == x')
  assert equivalent
```
